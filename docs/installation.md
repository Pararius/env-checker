## Installation

#### PHAR

This tool is automatically compiled into a PHAR on every release.
Go to our [releases](https://github.com/Pararius/env-checker/releases) page for the latest version.

```bash
wget https://github.com/pararius/env-checker/releases/download/VERSION/env-checker.phar
```

**NOTE:** Replace `VERSION` with the version you would like to install.


#### Composer

```bash
composer require --dev pararius/env-checker
```

**NOTE:** The rest of the documentation assumes you have installed env-checker using the PHAR method.
